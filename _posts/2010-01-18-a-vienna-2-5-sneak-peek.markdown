  content: One thing I personally would like to see is the ability to mark flagged
    a tab. So for example if I right click on an article and open it in a new tab
    inside Vienna and then want to flag the story for future reference I have to go
    back into the list of articles, find the relevant post and then flag it. A pain.

  content: Does any other news-reader do that? I'd be interested in how to do that
    UI-wise. It would also be limited to the case where there is absolutely ne re-direction
    or anything else going on from the URL that is mentioned in the RSS feed. That
    is not often the case on many of the popular blogs.

  content: "No, I don't think any other news reader does do that. It wasn't a criticism
    of Vienna I just thought it would be a good idea! Obviously not.\r\n\r\nI'll just
    have to use Evernote."

    already possible via scripts&#47;plugins?\r\n\r\nLooking forward to using the

<p>Vienna 2.5 will bring support for <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.vienna-rss.com&#47;?page_id=120">plugins<&#47;a> that are extremely easy to create, but at the same time are powerful enough to tailor Vienna to your needs. At the time of writing, there are two type of plugins: Link Plugins and Script Plugins. 2.5 will ship with at least three built-in ones: Share with <strong>Facebook<&#47;strong>, Share with <strong>Evernote<&#47;strong>, Share with <strong>Twitter<&#47;strong>:<br />

<strong>URL shortening<&#47;strong> happens automatically via bit.ly and is available to all plugins, all you need to do is a click a checkbox when you are creating yours. For more information, go read the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.vienna-rss.com&#47;?page_id=120">documentation<&#47;a>.
