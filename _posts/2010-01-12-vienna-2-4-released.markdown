  content: "Hi there,ma\r\n\r\nnice update! Looks good and works great.\r\n\r\nThere's
    just one thing I still miss: I use flags to mark articles, I already read and
    want to archive.\r\nI would like to be able to mark an article while reading it.
    Right now, when wanting to flagg an article, I have to go back to the main view,
    search for the articles title and mark it there.\r\n\r\nIt's not a big thing but
    anyway ;)\r\n\r\nNon the less: Viennas the best rss-viewer ever! Thanks for all
    the work.\r\n\r\nregards Axel"

<h2>Requirements<&#47;h2></p>
<p>Vienna 2.4 requires Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard or higher to run. Sorry, we can no longer support Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger.</p>
<h2>Database upgrade<&#47;h2></p>
<p>On the first launch, Vienna 2.4 will upgrade your database. Depending on the size of your database, the upgrade may take some time, so please be patient on first launch. Because of the database upgrade, we don't recommend that you switch back and forth between Vienna 2.4 and Vienna 2.3.</p>
<h2>Enhancements<&#47;h2></p>
<ul>
<li>Gesture Support:<&#47;li>
<ul>
<li>Enable navigating the built-in browser's back&#47;forward-list via  left&#47;right three-finger swipes.<&#47;li></p>
<li>Enable navigating feeds via left&#47;right three-finger swipes: Left for "Go Back" and right for "View Next Unread".<&#47;li>
<li>Enable scrolling to the top&#47;bottom of web pages and the article list via upwards&#47;downwards three-finger swipes.<&#47;li><&#47;ul>
<li> The XML source for feeds is now saved, and there is a new menu item "Show XML Source" to display it.<&#47;li>
<li>Add support for Internationalized Domain Names (IDN) in the built-in web browser.<&#47;li>
<li>Many user interface improvements.<&#47;li>
<li>Enable searching for text in the web browser. (Note that this required using the command-shift-g keyboard shortcut for "Find Previous", replacing the old shortcut for New Group Folder.)<&#47;li>
<li>Enable printing of web pages.<&#47;li>
<li>Double the number of simultaneous feed downloads during refreshing from 10 to 20.<&#47;li>
<li>Minor speed improvements for some operations.<&#47;li>
<li>An informative error page is displayed in the web browser when a page cannot be loaded.<&#47;li>
<li>Add support for the blog editor Blogo.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul></p>
<h2>Fixes<&#47;h2></p>
<ul>
<li>Fix a long standing bug where deleted articles would reappear after emptying the trash.<&#47;li>
<li>Eliminate drawing artifacts in the Folders and Articles headers. (Patch from Dan Crosta)<&#47;li>
<li>Fix a crash reported in Vienna forum topic 21303<&#47;li>
<li>Fix a crash when sorting articles by enclosure URL.<&#47;li>

<li>Fix a bug where changing the layout would hide the tab bar until relaunch.<&#47;li>

<li>Fix background drawing errors in main window and remove custom window background.<&#47;li>
<li>Fix drawing errors in Downloads window and remove the custom background.<&#47;li>
<li>Add a workaround for feeds that contain more than one item with the same guid. (For example, the WordPress Trac.)<&#47;li>

<li>Numerous fixes to localization of help pages and other strings in German, French, and other languages.<&#47;li>
