<p>It is important that you save your Google Reader subscription list before the service shuts down on July 1st ! This can be done with <a href="https:&#47;&#47;www.google.com&#47;takeout&#47;#custom:reader">Google Takeout<&#47;a>. Do it as soon as possible !!<br />
The interesting part is the subscriptions.xml file, which is an OPML file.</p>
<p>The next version of Vienna will support the "<a href="http:&#47;&#47;rss-sync.github.io&#47;Open-Reader-API&#47;rssconsensus&#47;">Open Reader API<&#47;a>", allowing synchronization through services supporting it.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;bazqux.com">Bazqux<&#47;a> and <a href="https:&#47;&#47;feedhq.org">FeedHQ<&#47;a> are the services I am currently testing with, and we made significant progresses in the last 48 hours. I'd like to thank Vladimir and Bruno for being so open-minded regarding interoperability and for their help.<br />
Bazqux and FeedHQ are also supported by Mr. Reader (iPad) and Feeddler Pro (iPhone).</p>
<p>If you prefer to wait before subscribing to a sync services, you can have your feeds set locally :<br />
- save your Google Reader subscription list as described before,<br />
- in Vienna Preferences, uncheck "Sync with Google Reader"<br />
- To avoid duplicates, delete all feeds&#47;folders marked with "[G]"<br />
- use the "File->Import Subscriptions&hellip;" menu item and select the subscriptions.xml file</p>
