<p><strong>Update Jan 1st, 2013<&#47;strong> : Refers to Beta 8</p>
<p>Hello to the readers of this blog from Barijaona, a relatively recent contributor to Vienna's code.</p>
<p>Vienna 3.0.0 Beta 8 is out ! Yes, there is a change in versions naming, but we are still speaking about the "product" some adventurous users have tried for a few weeks (and which has occasionnally burned their wings...).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, automatic update will not work for these users, as Github has stopped hosting binary files. I highly recommend them to <strong>manually<&#47;strong> download the new beta by following <a href="http:&#47;&#47;sourceforge.net&#47;projects&#47;vienna-rss&#47;files&#47;TestVersions&#47;3.0.0_beta8&#47;Vienna3.0.0_beta8.tgz&#47;download&#47;">this link<&#47;a>. The hosting is provided by <a href="https:&#47;&#47;sourceforge.net&#47;projects&#47;vienna-rss&#47;files&#47;TestVersions&#47;">SourceForge<&#47;a>. Thanks to them for providing for years important parts of this project infrastructure !</p>
<p>I did not encounter problems with this version for weeks now, but less tech-savvy people should not forget that we are speaking about a beta : I cannot yet certify that it is as stable as 2.6.0. You have been warned : it's a good idea to backup from time to time the Vienna folder in ~&#47;Application Support.</p>
<p>Thanks to the contributions of Github user @dak180, we have reorganized the different files of the project and its build architecture. We hope it will encourage more people to have a peek on the code, to see what is under the hood !</p>
