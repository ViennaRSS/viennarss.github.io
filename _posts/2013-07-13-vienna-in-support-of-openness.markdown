<p>We are very happy to present <a href="https:&#47;&#47;sourceforge.net&#47;projects&#47;vienna-rss&#47;files&#47;latest&#47;download">Vienna 3 Beta 12<&#47;a>.</p>
<p>The announcement of the end of Google Reader was indeed a shock ; but it also opened to talented developers and entrepreneurs a new range of opportunities for presenting some alternatives. For Vienna users, the end result should be more choice.</p>
<p>Vienna started as a standalone RSS reader. It is still perfectly able to be used this way.</p>
<p>But in a world where the use of portable devices is frequent, total or partial synchronisation of reading lists was a much needed feature. Now, we are able to indicate  to Vienna&#8217;s users at least three working solutions : </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.bazqux.com">Bazqux<&#47;a><&#47;li>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;feedhq.org">FeedHQ<&#47;a><&#47;li>
<li>any instance of FeedHQ running in the hosting environment of your choice (FeedHQ is an <a href="https:&#47;&#47;github.com&#47;feedhq&#47;feedhq">open source project<&#47;a>).<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul></p>
<p>Other services might work too, now or in the near future. We chose to support what is called the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;rss-sync.github.io&#47;Open-Reader-API&#47;rssconsensus&#47;">Open Reader API<&#47;a>, which is best summarized by <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.marco.org&#47;2013&#47;03&#47;14&#47;baby-steps-replacing-google-reader">this post by Marco Arment<&#47;a>. Bazqux and FeedHQ were considered a priority, because the commitment of their teams to this openness approach was clear. And they were very supportive of our efforts, providing ideas for current and future developments.</p>
<p>We will probably be able to add support of The Old Reader a little later. Feedly support might follow one day, but this is not yet a commitment, as a documentation review has yet to be done&hellip;</p>
<p>For mobile devices, we currently know of two applications which both support Bazqux and  FeedHQ : </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https:&#47;&#47;itunes.apple.com&#47;us&#47;app&#47;mr.-reader&#47;id412874834?mt=8">Mr. Reader<&#47;a> (iPad only)<&#47;li>
<li><a href="https:&#47;&#47;itunes.apple.com&#47;en&#47;app&#47;feeddler-rss-reader-pro&#47;id365710282?mt=8">Feeddler Pro<&#47;a>.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul></p>
<p>Please, note that we haven&#8217;t tested these iOS apps ourselves. Other solutions will probably emerge.</p>
<p>There are other changes in Vienna Beta 12. Here are the most important : </p>
<ul>
<li>Renamed our layouts : Horizontal, Vertical and Unified<&#47;li>
<li>The Unified layout has been completely rewritten. It now allows selection of an article (by use of a right click or a click in the left margin) for sharing it or marking it.<&#47;li>
<li>Vienna&#8217;s integrated browser is now able to present the user a file selection dialog (for instance for uploading a file)<&#47;li>
<li>Added a &#8220;Reindex Database&#8221; menu item<&#47;li>
<li>Fix problems with icons in Leopard and Snow Leopard<&#47;li>
<li>Visual tweaks and improvements<&#47;li>
<li>Translation improvements (Brazilian Portuguese, Dutch, German, French, Korean)<&#47;li>
<li>Many bugfixes<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul></p>
<p>And please, if you have been an user of Vienna for a while, take a minute to answer <a href="http:&#47;&#47;cocoaforge.com&#47;viewtopic.php?t=26269&amp;p=137020">this poll on keyboard shortcuts<&#47;a>.</p>
