The Vienna Development team is happy to announce the beta release of Vienna 2.5. This is a testing release that, among other things, adds extendability via a new [plugin development API]({{ '/development/creating-plugins' | prepend: site.baseurl }}) and fixes a small number of bugs. To be more precise, the new plugins make it extremely simple to extend Vienna with sharing capabilities that leverage social networking sites like [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com) and [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/ViennaRSS).

### Requirements

Vienna 2.5 BETA **requires Mac OS X 10.5** Leopard or higher to run.

### Pre-release software

The Vienna 2.5 BETA version is pre-release software, and it may contain bugs. If you discover a bug, please create a new topic here in the Vienna forum and report the bug to us. Some tips for writing good bug reports can be found at [https://forums.cocoaforge.com/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=9210](https://forums.cocoaforge.com/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=9210). For safety, we recommend that you back up your files before running the beta version. Vienna's files are located at "~/Library/Preferences/uk.co.opencommunity.vienna2.plist" and "~/Library/Application Support/Vienna". When 2.5 goes out of beta, Vienna will automatically update to the release version.

### New features

- Add support for **plugins**. For details, see the [Plugin Documentation]({{ '/development/creating-plugins' | prepend: site.baseurl }}).
- Add a facility for automatic URL shortening via bit.ly that can be used by all plugins.
- Add **"Share with Twitter"** plugin and toolbar button.
- Add **"Share with Facebook"** plugin and toolbar button.
- Add **"Share with Evernote"** plugin and toolbar button.
- Web plugins (especially audio- and video-players) now continue to operate while in the background.

### Fixes

- Fix bug that caused Vienna to become unresponsive after deleting a feed in Unified view.
- Update to the current version of Sparkle, which prevents auto-updating to a version of Vienna which will not run on the user's system.
- Fix bug where deleting a feed in Unified view mode would cause Vienna to stop working correctly.
