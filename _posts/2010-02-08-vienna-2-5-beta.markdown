  content: 'I agree that it would be nice. However: We''re not in competition with
    any-one :-) By all metrics available to us (downloads, forum posts, blog posts,
    Twitter, iusethis.com) Vienna''s user-base is also growing, not shrinking. We
    have started working on Google Reader synch, and it might make it into the next
    version. But really, it''s just not a pleasure to work on, and its just a fact
    open source developers scratch their own itch first and foremost.. It''s an undocumented
    API, after all...'

<p>The Vienna Development team is happy to announce the beta release of Vienna 2.5. This is a testing release that, among other things, adds extendability via a new <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.vienna-rss.org&#47;?page_id=120">plugin development API<&#47;a> and fixes a small number of bugs. To be more precise, the new plugins make it extremely simple to extend Vienna with sharing capabilities that leverage social networking sites like <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.facebook.com">Facebook<&#47;a> and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.twitter.com&#47;ViennaRSS">Twitter<&#47;a>. <center><a href="https:&#47;&#47;sourceforge.net&#47;projects&#47;vienna-rss&#47;files&#47;TestVersions&#47;2.5.0.2500&#47;Vienna2.5.0.2500-BETA.zip&#47;download"><img alt="Vienna 2.5 supports user-creatable plugins" src="http:&#47;&#47;www.vienna-rss.org&#47;img&#47;plugins.png" title="Vienna 2.5 supports user-creatable plugins" width="327" height="77" &#47;><&#47;a><br&#47;><br />

<h3>Requirements<&#47;h3><br />
Vienna 2.5 BETA <strong>requires Mac OS X 10.5<&#47;strong> Leopard or higher to run.</p>
<h3>Pre-release software<&#47;h3><br />
The Vienna 2.5 BETA version is pre-release software, and it may contain bugs. If you discover a bug, please create a new topic here in the Vienna forum and report the bug to us. Some tips for writing good bug reports can be found at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;forums.cocoaforge.com&#47;viewtopic.php?f=18&t=9210">http:&#47;&#47;forums.cocoaforge.com&#47;viewtopic.php?f=18&t=9210<&#47;a>. For safety, we recommend that you back up your files before running the beta version. Vienna's files are located at "~&#47;Library&#47;Preferences&#47;uk.co.opencommunity.vienna2.plist" and "~&#47;Library&#47;Application Support&#47;Vienna". When 2.5 goes out of beta, Vienna will automatically update to the release version.</p>
<h3>New features<&#47;h3></p>
<ul>
<li>Add support for <strong>plugins<&#47;strong>. For details, see the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.vienna-rss.org&#47;?page_id=120">Plugin Documentation<&#47;a>.
<li>Add a facility for automatic URL shortening via bit.ly that can be used by all plugins.
<li>Add <strong>"Share with Twitter"<&#47;strong> plugin and toolbar button.
<li>Add <strong>"Share with Facebook"<&#47;strong> plugin and toolbar button.
<li>Add <strong>"Share with Evernote"<&#47;strong> plugin and toolbar button.
<li>Web plugins (especially audio- and video-players) now continue to operate while in the background.<br />
<&#47;ul></p>
<h3>Fixes<&#47;h3></p>
<ul>
<li>Fix bug that caused Vienna to become unresponsive after deleting a feed in Unified view.
<li>Update to the current version of Sparkle, which prevents auto-updating to a version of Vienna which will not run on the user's system.
<li>Fix bug where deleting a feed in Unified view mode would cause Vienna to stop working correctly.<br />
<&#47;ul></p>
