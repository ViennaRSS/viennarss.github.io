<p>Hi all!</p>
<p>Just a short note to let you know that Vienna is not dead, it was just sleeping. Development will be starting back up soon and I hope to bring you a lovely new version to coincide with the release of OS X El Capitan later this year.</p>
<p>We will be migrating the website from WordPress to GitHub Pages in the coming weeks as well. Stay tuned for more news! </p>
