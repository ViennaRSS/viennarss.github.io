<p>Just as a quick reminder: Vienna, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.newsgator.com&#47;INDIVIDUALS&#47;NETNEWSWIRE&#47;">NetNewsWire<&#47;a> and probably a few other apps implement <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.inessential.com">Brent Simmon's<&#47;a> excellent and useful <a href="http:&#47;&#47;ranchero.com&#47;netnewswire&#47;developers&#47;externalinterface">External Weblog Editor Interface<&#47;a>. If you implement the receiving portion of this protocol, we can send you information about posts, websites, etc. which you can then re-use in your application. </p>
<p>Vienna even has a facility for creating plugins (with toolbar buttons and menu entries) that make this process a one-click affair for your users. If you have any questions about this, don't hesitate to ask on the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;forums.cocoaforge.com&#47;viewforum.php?f=20">Developer Forum<&#47;a>. Applications that already implement this include Cocoalicious, Pukka, Ecto, MarsEdit, etc...</p>
