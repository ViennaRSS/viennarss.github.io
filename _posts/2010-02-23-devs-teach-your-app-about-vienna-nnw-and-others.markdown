Just as a quick reminder: Vienna, [NetNewsWire](http://www.newsgator.com/INDIVIDUALS/NETNEWSWIRE/) and probably a few other apps implement [Brent Simmon's](http://www.inessential.com) excellent and useful [External Weblog Editor Interface](http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/developers/externalinterface). If you implement the receiving portion of this protocol, we can send you information about posts, websites, etc. which you can then re-use in your application.

Vienna even has a facility for creating plugins (with toolbar buttons and menu entries) that make this process a one-click affair for your users. If you have any questions about this, don't hesitate to ask on the [Developer Forum](https://forums.cocoaforge.com/viewforum.php?f=18). Applications that already implement this include Cocoalicious, Pukka, Ecto, MarsEdit, etc...
