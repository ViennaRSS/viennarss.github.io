The Vienna Dev Team is proud to announce the release of Vienna 2.5. Among other things, it adds extendability via a new [plugin development API]({{ '/development/creating-plugins' | prepend: site.baseurl }}) and fixes a small number of bugs. To be more precise, the new plugins make it extremely simple to extend Vienna with sharing capabilities that leverage social networking sites like [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com) and [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/ViennaRSS). Special thanks go to [Curtis Faith](http://www.curtisfaith.com), who contributed bug fixes for this release.
