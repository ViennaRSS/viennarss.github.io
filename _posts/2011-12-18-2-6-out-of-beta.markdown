  content: That is rather weird - it worked on all our test machines. Please download
    it via the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;sourceforge.net&#47;projects&#47;vienna-rss&#47;files&#47;ReleasedVersions&#47;2.6.0&#47;Vienna2.6.0.2601.zip&#47;download"
    rel="nofollow">download link<&#47;a> and just manually replace the old version
    with the new one. Your database is stored elsewhere, so all your data wil survive

  content: I too have been using 2.6 (beta) flawlessly since its release. The new
    2.6 (stable) does not support OS X 10.5.8 PPC architecture. Thought it might,
    since the beta works so well. Any possibility of getting PPC capabilities back?

    Outlook, Cyberduck, Address Book, Twitter... their UI doesn't default to that

    \"natural\". Can I change it? Can you change it?\r\nBesides that: Good work, thanks

<p>2.6 has been stable for a very, very long time - so I'll just make it official :-) One small but handy thing that I added is a plugin for effortless sharing with <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.bufferapp.com">Buffer<&#47;a>. It's a very useful service that has popped up between the beta release and now - check it out and have fun!</p>
