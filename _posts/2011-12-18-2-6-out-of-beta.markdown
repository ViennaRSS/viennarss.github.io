  content: That is rather weird - it worked on all our test machines. Please download
    it via the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;sourceforge.net&#47;projects&#47;vienna-rss&#47;files&#47;ReleasedVersions&#47;2.6.0&#47;Vienna2.6.0.2601.zip&#47;download"
    rel="nofollow">download link<&#47;a> and just manually replace the old version
    with the new one. Your database is stored elsewhere, so all your data wil survive

  content: I too have been using 2.6 (beta) flawlessly since its release. The new
    2.6 (stable) does not support OS X 10.5.8 PPC architecture. Thought it might,
    since the beta works so well. Any possibility of getting PPC capabilities back?

    \"natural\". Can I change it? Can you change it?\r\nBesides that: Good work, thanks

<p>2.6 has been stable for a very, very long time - so I'll just make it official :-) One small but handy thing that I added is a plugin for effortless sharing with <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.bufferapp.com">Buffer<&#47;a>. It's a very useful service that has popped up between the beta release and now - check it out and have fun!</p>
