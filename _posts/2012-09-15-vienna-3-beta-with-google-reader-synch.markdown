<p>Since I transferred <a href="https:&#47;&#47;github.com&#47;ViennaRSS&#47;vienna-rss">Vienna's development to GitHub<&#47;a>, we have been getting lots and lots of great contributions to the project. Chief among new contributors are <a href="http:&#47;&#47;ansani.it&#47;">Salvatore Ansani<&#47;a> and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blog.barijaona.com&#47;">Barijaona Ramaholimihaso<&#47;a>. Their work has led to a new release of Vienna, which you can now download here:</p>
