<p><em>UPDATED Jan 2nd 2012  : download link has been updated and refers to 3.0.0 Beta 8<&#47;em></p>
<p>Since I transferred <a href="https:&#47;&#47;github.com&#47;ViennaRSS&#47;vienna-rss">Vienna's development to GitHub<&#47;a>, we have been getting lots and lots of great contributions to the project. Chief among new contributors are <a href="http:&#47;&#47;ansani.it&#47;">Salvatore Ansani<&#47;a> and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blog.barijaona.com&#47;">Barijaona Ramaholimihaso<&#47;a>. Their work has led to a new release of Vienna, which you can now download here:</p>

They have been working on a slew of bug-fixes and improvements (Google Reader support!) that you can now find in Vienna 3 BETA:</p>
