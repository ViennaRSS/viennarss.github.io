Today, we would like to introduce a new contributor: [Curtis Faith](http://www.curtisfaith.com/) (a.k.a. *inflector* on the [Forum](http://forums.cocoaforge.com/viewforum.php?f=18)). He's not only a very [interesting](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0137047681?ie=UTF8&tag=curtisfaith-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0137047681) [author](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/007148664X?ie=UTF8&tag=curtisfaith-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=007148664X) but also, it turns out, a great programmer. You can download an alpha version of Vienna 2.6 that includes a handy new feature added by him:[ Full Web-Page Feeds](http://forums.cocoaforge.com/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=22029). This is very handy for sites that only put headlines or very short summaries in their feeds. You can now set those to immediately load the associated web-page in the reading-pane:
![Full Web Page Feds]({{ '/images/fwpf.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }})
