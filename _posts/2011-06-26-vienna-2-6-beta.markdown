  content: Glad somebody's keeping Vienna alive! Been using it for about 3 years,
    and it's the best free reader in my opinion (even with no updates for the last
    16 months).

  content: "A greeting and thank you very much for this program.\r\n\r\nTwo requests:\r\n\r\nCan
    you put an option to do a full zoom (also images) and another to show &#47; hide
    the sidebar (menu items)? \r\n\r\nThis would be perfect.\r\n\r\nThanks and sorry
    for my English."

  content: "WORD&hellip;besides the Fact that i actually live in vienna this program
    is so awesome that all it took was a few minutes to try it and I immediately dumped
    all the Other RSS readers i had tried over years and years of being unhappy with
    the one's I had used so far!\r\nAt this point thumbs up for the development team
    you guys did an Incredible Job in putting together a unique and great peace of
    software!"

  content: "Thought I'd throw in my 2 cents. I've been using the 2.6 BETA since nearly
    the moment you advertised its existence here on the Vienna web site. Maybe it
    doesn't have all the features intended for it; maybe I don't utilize everything
    it has to offer;  but I find it to be very stable for my plain-vanilla usage.
    I have used it every day since installation -- no crashes, no hiccups, absolutely
    no problems.\r\n\r\nI'm subscribed to the Vienna developer forum so I can track
    what's going on. I am very pleased some Vienna fans, with the programming know-how,
    are working toward a new, \"stable\" version. I just hope they don't write my
    architecture (PPC G4, OS X 10.5.8) out of the equation, like so many others have
    in the last year. Maybe it's not considered \"cost effective\", but fans are fans.\r\n\r\nPlease
    keep Vienna going. I've paid for a licenses to other readers, but I find them
    a bit quirky, and do not like them as much as Vienna.\r\n\r\nThank-you for Vienna!\r\nRichard"

  content: I'd second philostein's comments. I am coming back to Vienna after disappointment
    with various App Store downloads. I really appreciate having a good-quality RSS
    client that is _not_ dependent on Google Reader.
