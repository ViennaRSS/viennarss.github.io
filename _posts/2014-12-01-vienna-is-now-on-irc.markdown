To all those who wish to participate in a lively discussion about all things Vienna related (past, present, and future!), you can now find the #ViennaRSS (no, that isn't a hashtag!) channel on the freenode IRC network (chat.freenode.net).

If you don't have an IRC client handy, you can try [Colloquy](http://colloquy.info/) or the [freenode webchat client](https://webchat.freenode.net/).

I hope to see you all there!
