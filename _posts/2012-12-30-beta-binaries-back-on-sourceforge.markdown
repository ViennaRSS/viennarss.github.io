**Update Jan 1st, 2013** : Refers to Beta 8

Hello to the readers of this blog from Barijaona, a relatively recent contributor to Vienna's code.

Vienna 3.0.0 Beta 8 is out ! Yes, there is a change in versions naming, but we are still speaking about the "product" some adventurous users have tried for a few weeks (and which has occasionnally burned their wings...).

Unfortunately, automatic update will not work for these users, as Github has stopped hosting binary files. I highly recommend them to **manually** download the new beta by following [this link](http://sourceforge.net/projects/vienna-rss/files/TestVersions/3.0.0_beta8/Vienna3.0.0_beta8.tgz/download/). The hosting is provided by [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vienna-rss/files/TestVersions/). Thanks to them for providing for years important parts of this project infrastructure !

I did not encounter problems with this version for weeks now, but less tech-savvy people should not forget that we are speaking about a beta : I cannot yet certify that it is as stable as 2.6.0. You have been warned : it's a good idea to backup from time to time the Vienna folder in ~/Application Support.

Thanks to the contributions of Github user @dak180, we have reorganized the different files of the project and its build architecture. We hope it will encourage more people to have a peek on the code, to see what is under the hood !
